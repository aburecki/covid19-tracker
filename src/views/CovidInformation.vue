                            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
                                respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[9] It was first identified in December
                                2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.[10][11] The first
                                confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei.[12] Traces of the
                                virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin, Italy, on
                                18 December 2019.[13] The virus was also detected in studies being done in wastewater
                                collected from Barcelona, Spain, as early as, March 12, 2019.[14][15][16][17] As of 2
                                July 2020, more than 10.6 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and
                                territories, resulting in more than 516,000 deaths. More than 5.48 million people have
                                recovered.[8]

                            <h3 class="has-text-centered">Signs and symptoms</h3>
                            <p> Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19[18], but is highly variable in severity and
                                presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having
                                fever at all.[43][44] In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to
                                the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their
                                hospitalization.[45]

                                Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath,
                                sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.[18][1][5][46] Symptoms such as nausea,
                                vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[47][48][49] Less
                                common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.[50] Some
                                cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.[51] A
                                decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.[52][53] Loss of smell was a
                                presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.[19][54]

                                As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first
                                infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period.
                                The typical incubation period for COVIDâ€‘19 is five or six days, but it can range from
                                one to fourteen days[6][55] with approximately ten percent of cases taking
                                longer.[56][57][58]

                                An early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness. Early symptoms may include a
                                wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. Shortness of
                                breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. Shortness of breath that
                                begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be anxiety than
                                COVID-19. The most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development
                                of shortness of breath.[59]

                                A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[60] These
                                asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not
                                fully known.[61][62] Preliminary evidence suggested they may contribute to the spread of
                                the disease.[63] In June 2020, a spokeswoman of WHO said that asymptomatic transmission
                                appears to be "rare," but the evidence for the claim was not released.[64] The next day,
                                WHO clarified that they had intended a narrow definition of "asymptomatic" that did not
                                include pre-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (weak symptoms) transmission and that up to
                                41% of transmission may be asymptomatic. Transmission without symptoms does occur.[60]
